### Description
What Is Bike Sharing?

Bike share is an innovative public transportation program offering a network of bicycles for short-term use. Through automated, self-service bike check-out stations, bike share combines the flexibility and freedom of a bicycle with the accessibility of public transportation. Bike share systems enhance mobility within a city, promote tourism and economic development, and offer a fun and healthy way of getting around town. Extending the reach of public transit, bike share systems create connections - connecting people to where they live, work and play, and to other modes of transportation. 

Bikeshare.py is a tool to help us understand usage patterns for our bikes in major metro areas around the US.
With features that help us further refine our services and enhance our user base's experience, BikeShare.py is a tool about bike users and for bike users. 

The sub 300 lines of python code is optimized to be fast and utilize efficient packqages such as numpy. 

## Usage
This is an interview style script that collects data from the end user to shape the output of statistics.
Run the script with no arguments and respond to each of the prompts. 
At the end of each run an option is provided to restart the data analysis without quitting the current session.
